# Write-Log

Write-Log function taken from [PowerShell Application Deployment Toolkit (PSADT) v3.10.2](https://psappdeploytoolkit.com/) and modified to:

1. Require PowerShell 7
1. Enable Cross-Platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) compatibility
1. Remove PSADT integrated logic

Created Pester Tests to ensure function works as expected.
